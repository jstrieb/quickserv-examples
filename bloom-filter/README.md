# Bloom Filter Creator

This code uses a QuickServ web interface for creating small [Bloom
filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter). 

Compile by doing `make`. Note that `gcc` is required for compilation to succeed.

Each string submitted on its own line from the web interface will be added as an
entry in the Bloom filter. This code can be used with the web front-end.
Alternatively, text can be `POST`ed directly to the back-end, which can be used
as a fast, server-side Bloom filter generator.

Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures, which means that when you query
whether a string is in the set represented by the Bloom filter, the response
from the data structure is either "no," or "probably yes." Bloom filters have
two parameters that can be tuned to minimize the likelihood of false positive
results: the size of the filter (the number of bits), and the number of hashes
used to obtain a fingerprint of each item.

Based on calculations performed using [this Bloom filter
calculator](https://hur.st/bloomfilter/?n=4M&p=&m=16MiB&k=23), the Bloom filters
generated by this code occupy 16MB of space and use 23 hash functions.
