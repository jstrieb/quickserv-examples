# PDF Tools

This is a collection of PDF tools in the spirit of
[Smallpdf](https://smallpdf.com/pdf-tools). When run, there is a web interface
that lets you:

- Add a password to PDF files
- Remove a password from PDF files
- Compress PDF files
- Turn a PDF into an image
- Merge multiple PDF files
- Rotate PDF files

This code depends on having the following command line tools installed:

- `qpdf`
- `imagemagick`
- `pdfunite`
- `gs` (GhostScript)
